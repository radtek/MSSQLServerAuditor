		<description>
			This script will display CPU usage on the server. The data comes from dm_os_ring_buffers
			which only stored data for the past 4 HOURS. Within the ring buffers, data is averaged
			at the minute level. There are variables limit the results to a smaller time window and
			for hiding the details.
